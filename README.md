# lemon-server

A test to build out a basic signing server for LEMON JUICE while at Frameworks 2024.
Ultimately we decided to go down a different path.



To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.35. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
